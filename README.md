# RAG Project with Langchain and Llama 3.2

This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline that leverages Langchain alongside Llama 3.2. It allows users to upload and index documents (such as PDFs) and then ask questions that are answered using a combination of document retrieval and advanced language model generation.

## Features

- **RAG Pipeline:** Combines document retrieval and language generation for informed responses.
- **Langchain Integration:** Seamless handling of document processing and retrieval.
- **Llama 3.2:** Utilizes a state-of-the-art language model for generating answers.
- **Streamlit Frontend:** A user-friendly interface hosted on Streamlit for local deployment.
- **PDF Upload & Indexing:** Easily upload your own PDFs, which are then processed and indexed for query-based interaction.
