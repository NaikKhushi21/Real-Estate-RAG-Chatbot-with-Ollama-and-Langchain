# Real-Estate-RAG-Chatbot-with-Ollama-and-Langchain

This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline that leverages Langchain alongside Llama 3.2. It allows users to upload and index documents (such as PDFs) and then ask questions that are answered using a combination of document retrieval and advanced language model generation.

## Features

- **RAG Pipeline:** Combines document retrieval and language generation for informed responses.
- **Langchain Integration:** Seamless handling of document processing and retrieval.
- **Llama 3.2:** Utilizes a state-of-the-art language model for generating answers.
